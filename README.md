# wdi-project-2

### Introduction
**Dev.cast** is a simple full stack web app where users can create a playlist of their favourite technology podcasts. Having recently discovered the joys of listening to podcasts on the work commute, I decided it would be a good theme to fit the project brief. This is **second project** on the *Web Development Immersive* course at **General Assembly, London** using **node.js & express**. A hosted version of **Dev.cast** can be found [here] (https://frozen-basin-59637.herokuapp.com/)
The code can be viewed [here] (https://github.com/brian-cooney/wdi-project-2)

### How the app works
The home screen displays a list of currently trending tech podcasts using the iTunes API. The user must register or login to create a playlist. Once logged in, the user can search the iTunes database with the results displayed in a carousel by ***slick***.    

### Project Brief
1. Create a **full-stack RESTful application** that includes authentication.
2. Built with **Express** that has a **Mongo** database using **Mongoose**.
3. Sketch the app using wireframes and write the user story.  


### Wireframing with Balsamiq

I used balsamiq & sketch to plan the app. Both were great for making fast wireframes. This made for a smoother development experience and I could get feedback from others before jumoing into coding to fast.

### Trello
We were introduced to trello during this project and encouraged to use it's stickies board as a way to keep organized and track progress of the tasks that needed to be done.
